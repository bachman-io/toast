## Install

Ideally, you'll have the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start) installed globally into NPM.

1. Clone the repo to a working directory.
2. run an `npm install`.
3. Create an `.env.development` file at the project root using the `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES`.
4. Run `gatsby develop` and/or get to coding.
5. Run `gatsby build` for an optimized production build of the site.
